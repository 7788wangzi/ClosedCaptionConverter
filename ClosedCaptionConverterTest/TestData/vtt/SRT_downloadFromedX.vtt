00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.310
Hello, my name is Audrie.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.010
I'm a Senior Program Manager on the PowerApps product team.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.670
And I'm excited to bring you some more

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.530
goodness about PowerApps in the next series of videos.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.300
As you've already seen in previous sections,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.950
we have been talking about the Contoso Flooring Company.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.890
And you already have made an app,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.530
if you've visited the other sections, that helps to

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.140
estimate the cost of flooring for a particular room.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.840
That was a great app.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.625
Today, I'm going to take you a little bit further

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:35.190
into this process, and I'm gonna show you some additional skills

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.950
in the area of galleries and forms.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.500
To get you started though, I'd like to help you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.290
make a data set with me using only a formula.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.770
This data set will enable us to build the galleries

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.060
that will be used in this next app.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.330
So in your resources you should have a text file.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.816
And let me show you what the text file looks like.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:01:00.924
The text file is called collection data formula.

00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:04.211
And within that text file is a single formula,

00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:06.993
I know it's a pretty long formula, but

00:01:06.993 --> 00:01:11.231
after all we are making a whole table with just one formula.

00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:14.848
And we're using the ClearCollect function to do that.

00:01:14.848 --> 00:01:18.724
To break this down, immediately after the ClearCollect function

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:22.335
which is this long, you'll find the name of the collection.

00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:25.621
We will refer to this name very often.

00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:29.022
What this is, is our CitySales table.

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:32.118
So imagine that we have been selling flooring and

00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:34.080
now we are ready to look back and

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.251
see how many sales we had in different countries,

00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:41.430
in addition to different cities in the United States.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.260
So we are creating a table of data for those sales.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.640
If you look at this, you'll notice very quickly

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.480
that there are words followed by colons.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.830
Those words represent column headers and

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.110
the words within quotes after them represent the value for

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.620
that header for that particular column.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.628
At the end of each row is our sales figure, and you'll see

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:12.428
these very large numbers that represent the total sales for

00:02:12.428 --> 00:02:13.190
that city.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.848
So what we're going to do to actually create our collection

00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:22.133
that we will use in the galleries is we're gonna select

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:26.323
all of that, and I suggest that you only use Notepad,

00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:28.021
to select that data.

00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:31.555
Because if you use any other application, it's possible that

00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:35.022
they'll try to make your quotes a little prettier, and those

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:38.660
curly quotes or pretty quotes don't work so well in PowerApps.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.590
So it's best to continue to copy and paste from Notepad.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.870
So I'm going to just copy this data.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.070
You can either do an edit copy or a Ctrl + C.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.026
And then I'm going to open up in the desktop version

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:53.223
of PowerApps,

00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:57.006
a brand new application which is a phone layout.

00:02:57.006 --> 00:03:00.430
And you'll see that on the lower section here.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.200
I'm gonna click on phone layout.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.910
And once I've done that I will get a brand new screen.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.280
I think in previous sections,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.040
you've also had a look at the properties.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.210
I'm going to go straight to the OnVisible property

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.680
of this screen.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.630
Because what I want to do is build the collection

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.090
as soon as this screen is visible.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.320
So I'm gonna click in the formula area, and

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.600
I'm going to paste what I've copied from my clipboard.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.442
If I scroll over here to the right you'll see that I can make

00:03:31.442 --> 00:03:32.955
this bigger and look at it all.

00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:37.358
And look how cool that looks, all of my cities and countries,

00:03:37.358 --> 00:03:41.763
my abbreviations and my sales data have been color-coded for

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.371
me to make it easier for

00:03:43.371 --> 00:03:47.116
me to validate that my data is formatted correctly.

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:48.314
Now it is possible,

00:03:48.314 --> 00:03:51.061
this is a mistake I've made quite a few times,

00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:54.670
that you might copy and paste and you don't get everything.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.310
Maybe you missed the first letter, or

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.810
you missed the last mark.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.740
So in this case,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.750
I've deleted the C, which is the first letter.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.499
And you see it all went red.

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:04.760
Don't let that panic you.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.330
It's okay, it just means something's missing.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.560
So I usually check and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.350
see if I've missed something in the beginning.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.850
And nine times out of ten, that's what caused it.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.090
And then towards the end,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.850
if you forget the paren, there's a little red dot that shows up.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.900
And that little red dot

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.980
there means you haven't closed the functions.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.270
So you need that closing paren.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.700
So once I have all of that and it looks nice and

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.690
neat, then I'm gonna come out of that formula bar, and

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.410
I'm gonna insert a new screen.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.980
My only purpose there is to create a trigger, I want to

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.270
trigger that OnVisible, so that my collection is built.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.200
By going back to screen one I trigger the OnVisible.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.130
And if you go to the Content tab and

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.030
you look in Collections, voila, there's the table we created.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.321
Look how easy it is to create data directly in your PowerApp.

00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:55.555
Now don't be surprised, you won't see all the data,

00:04:55.555 --> 00:04:58.521
you'll just see a preview of the first five rows.

00:04:58.521 --> 00:04:59.514
But that's good,

00:04:59.514 --> 00:05:03.200
at least it validates that we have all of the data we needed.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.590
So now that we have our data, let's get ready in the next

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.450
video to see how we can format that in a brand new gallery.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.380
Thank you for looking at this video and

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.740
I hope it taught you something that you could use later on
