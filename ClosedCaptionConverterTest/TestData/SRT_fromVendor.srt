00:00:01,107 --> 00:00:06,106
Before we jump into our demonstrations and we start walking through our specific scenarios,

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,052
let's take an opportunity just to introduce you to the

3
00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:11,524
company that we'll be using throughout this entire course.

4
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:14,317
And so they're a financial services company named HCL,

5
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:17,949
and they really focus on large to enterprise customers,

6
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:20,404
although they do some have small and medium size business

7
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:23,310
customers in there as well. The size of the deals,

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,867
they really do loans and loan generation as well as some financing

9
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:30,813
options both for new construction as well as existing construction,

10
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:37,430
as well as they do some lease referral information as well. And depending on the size of the deal,

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,803
it really varies depending upon the specific product services that they're looking at, and sometimes that

12
00:00:42,803 --> 00:00:47,223
can be affected by some of the different loan origination dates and items that they're working with.

13
00:00:47,223 --> 00:00:51,633
They do have a lot of customers who are very heavy on social media, and we'll talk a

14
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:55,554
little bit more about the social media aspect of it when we get into another module,

15
00:00:55,554 --> 00:01:01,351
but they do have a very proven sales methodology that really isn't being followed by their employees.

16
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:04,643
And so what they've noticed over the last year or so is that they've

17
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:07,806
really started to lose a lot more deals than they normally do,

18
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:10,520
and they've been able to really trace that back to not

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,523
following the proven sales methodology that they have.

20
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:16,975
So they want to come up with a better way to be able to enforce

21
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:19,938
that functionality and be able to work with it from there.

22
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:24,977
And they also have their leads coming in from many different scenarios. It could be customers coming

23
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:30,671
in to trade shows and sales or relationship executives entering that information into the system.

24
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:33,927
It could be leads coming in from websites that they're looking

25
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,561
at. It could just be items coming into the application.

26
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:40,611
But they want to provide multiple ways for leads to come into the system. And then they

27
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:45,590
also understand that many of their users spend a lot of their time in other applications,

28
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,302
it might be Outlook, might be Word, might be Excel, and they want to be

29
00:01:49,302 --> 00:01:53,113
sure that they're able to leverage some of those existing technologies,

30
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:57,752
particularly from an Outlook perspective, to be able to effectively enter

31
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:02,372
information into the application without having to do a lot of back and forth.

32
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,093
And so that's really the company that we're going to look at in this particular module, and the

33
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:12,479
remaining items are really going to identify how Dynamics 365 for Sales can really help provide

34
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,070
each one of those individual situations and meet those needs that they're looking for.
