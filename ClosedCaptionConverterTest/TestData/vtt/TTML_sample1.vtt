WEBVTT

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.030
&gt;&gt; Everybody, as the top of the hour,

00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:05.250
we're going to give people another couple of

00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:08.130
minutes to join from other mediums

00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:12.400
so we'll get started in two minutes.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.340
All right, folks. We're going to give it about one

00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:17.110
more minute before we get started.

00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:21.540
All right, everybody.

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:22.890
It's a couple of minutes after the hour,

00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.800
we're going to go ahead and get started as people join.

00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.850
Welcome to the May 2018 Skype

00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:32.745
for Business and Microsoft Teams Readiness Brown Bag.

00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:34.200
My name is Tim Ballew,

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.240
and I am the Business Program Manager

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:38.770
for CSS Learning for these products,

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.580
and I'm joined today by members of our Readiness Team:

00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:43.305
our learning development managers

00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:45.390
and instructional designers.

00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:47.440
During today's session, we'll be

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:49.590
reviewing the May feature releases and updates for

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.945
Skype for Business and Teams' product family

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:53.100
and we'll be providing

00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:54.930
you some additional resources

00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.450
for more information on those items.

00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:59.880
We anticipate that today's session

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.600
will be roughly 50 minutes,

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:04.570
we won't necessarily take the whole hour this time.

00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:06.220
And please note that

00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:08.275
a recording will be made available as

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:12.200
a training and success factors after the session is over.

00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:15.600
So, a real quick reminder

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:20.060
about our confidentiality obligations.

00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:22.855
We do not disclose confidential information,

00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:25.220
and this information that we're sharing today has not

00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:27.525
necessarily been reviewed for public consumption.

00:01:27.526 --> 00:01:29.740
So, be aware.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.380
Today we're going to be looking at

00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:35.950
typical topics of Lync and Skype for Business Server.

00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:38.150
We'll be talking about Skype

00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:39.970
for Business Online Calling Plans,

00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:43.805
Direct Routing and Coexistence Modes.

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:46.040
Our Phones and Devices section will

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:48.985
cover Skype Room Systems updates,

00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:52.360
and they will cover all of the clients.

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.840
We'll talk a little bit about the network assessment tool

00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:59.900
and then review current recently released trainings,

00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:02.525
they have the upcoming trainings to look out for.

00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:05.700
So, with that I'm going to go

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:08.510
ahead and hand it over to Darren Hansen,

00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:09.690
who is going to walk us through

00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:12.890
our features and fixes. Darren!

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.280
&gt;&gt; All right thank you much Tim.

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:17.900
All right, so we're going to start off

00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:19.040
today with an update

00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:22.070
for Skype for Business Server 2015.

00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:27.165
This is highly anticipated CU for CU7.

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:31.160
It is going to come out here in June in a little bit.

00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:33.380
We don't have an exact date but it should be

00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:35.300
coming up in the next few weeks.

00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:38.450
So, there are a lot of

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.700
fixes and improvements and

00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:42.695
stuff like that that have gone into this update.

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:45.610
We're going to highlight a few here on the slides,

00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:48.630
and then the majority of them are in the appendix,

00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:50.935
which is linked right down here.

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.940
So, the first one that we're going to talk

00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.010
about is an issue where we now

00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:57.590
support anonymous PSTN callers starting

00:02:57.591 --> 00:02:59.510
a static meeting without

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:02.525
an authenticated user in Skype for Business.

00:03:02.526 --> 00:03:04.760
Another one where we support

00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:06.830
the end meeting functionality for

00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:09.995
Skype for Business on Mac in 2015,

00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:13.160
enabling Skype meetings app to replace

00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:14.810
the Skype for Business Web app and

00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:17.540
Skype for Business Server 2015.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.265
Then Microsoft SQL servers

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:25.285
2016 is available for the back end server.

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:28.010
Oh! I'm sorry, Thank you Colin.

00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:31.130
I did not take over as presenter there.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.710
All right so now you should be seeing

00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:35.810
the Skype for Business Server 2015

00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:40.350
slides with a few improvements here on the screen.

00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:42.820
So, we get to the last one there were

00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:45.220
Microsoft SQL server 2016 is available

00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:49.200
for backend servers of Skype for Business Server 2015.

00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:51.270
So, we now support that.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.485
And again, there are probably

00:03:54.486 --> 00:03:58.190
20 or more additional fixes and improvements

00:03:58.191 --> 00:04:01.130
in the appendix there so make sure you download the deck

00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:04.570
from the meeting attachments and take a look there.

00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.520
So, now moving off of

00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:10.310
server and onto sort of Skype for Business online,

00:04:10.311 --> 00:04:12.225
you can see that all of these things have to do

00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:16.180
with Microsoft Teams but they also do

00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:19.700
reflect functionality and Skype for Business

00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:21.350
online too for customers who are

00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:23.860
using for example calling plans,

00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:28.090
Direct Routing and coexistence modes apply.

00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.945
But, as we move forward

00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:32.030
you'll also see in the top right hand corner

00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:36.380
that there are some logos for Teams and Skype.

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:39.295
Those just help you know which

00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:40.580
one we're talking about on each

00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:42.080
individual slide as we go through the deck,

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.750
you see we've made some updates to the template.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:45.920
So, we're just trying to

00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:47.615
make that a little bit more clear.

00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:50.450
So, Microsoft Teams and

00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:52.340
Skype for Business Online calling plans in

00:04:52.341 --> 00:04:54.530
Canada are now general available,

00:04:54.531 --> 00:04:57.910
that was updated or released on May first.

00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:00.980
So, all calls between US and Canada users in

00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:02.360
both directions are now considered

00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:05.225
domestic and not international so that's a big win.

00:05:05.226 --> 00:05:07.535
Calling plans work with both teams

00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:09.415
as well as Skype for Business and you can buy

00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:13.720
today in Office 365 together obviously,

00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:15.350
they make calling enabled for

00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:19.275
your organization using your primary phone number.

00:05:19.276 --> 00:05:23.285
So, make sure your customers know about that.

00:05:23.286 --> 00:05:25.950
There is information in the blog here.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.690
Direct Routing, if you

00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:32.315
haven't heard about Direct Routing before.

00:05:32.316 --> 00:05:35.645
It's essentially CCE or Cloud.

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:38.705
There are definitely two different things

00:05:38.706 --> 00:05:40.400
but this is basically using

00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:45.680
your on premise infrastructure with Teams to route calls.

00:05:45.681 --> 00:05:48.900
So, this was released on May 15.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.655
Customers can choose to sign up for preview

00:05:52.656 --> 00:05:54.910
and they will get support through our in market teams.

00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:57.505
It is a preview release,

00:05:57.506 --> 00:05:59.255
so just be aware of that.

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:01.880
What if you do get a call and you

00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.540
need assistance with answering direct routing calls?

00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:06.695
You can post your question here,

00:06:06.696 --> 00:06:10.085
which leads to the real one note I believe,

00:06:10.086 --> 00:06:12.260
and SME will respond or you

00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:14.370
can reach out to one of these SMEs listed.

00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:17.055
So, I know that there are some of you on the phone,

00:06:17.056 --> 00:06:18.925
who are on this list so,

00:06:18.926 --> 00:06:22.380
I hope you don't get too many calls or questions.

00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:24.260
There's also plenty of

00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:27.265
information in our training that we just released,

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:30.570
as well as the UC real one note documents.

00:06:30.571 --> 00:06:33.890
So, Carolyn and other SMEs did a

00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.260
really bang up job in documenting Direct Routing,

00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:39.820
documenting troubleshooting methodologies,

00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:42.440
scenarios, all sorts of stuff.

00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:45.530
So, it's very well understood product

00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:47.740
at this point and we're just entering previews.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:54.890
So, coexistence mode, you may have also heard about this.

00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:58.310
Greg talked about it in our last brown bag last month,

00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:00.200
when he demo the modern portal

00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:02.450
and the modes for upgrading.

00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:06.815
So, the modern portal now removes the interrupt policy

00:07:06.816 --> 00:07:08.090
and upgrade policy as

00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:12.335
two separate entities and gives us coexistence modes.

00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:14.555
The goal is to consolidate

00:07:14.556 --> 00:07:16.070
the upgrade experience when

00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:18.020
transitioning from Skype for Business to Teams,

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.550
because it's pretty confusing as it is today.

00:07:20.551 --> 00:07:23.370
There are some customers and TAP,

00:07:23.371 --> 00:07:28.390
who have already set the Teams interrupt policy before,

00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:32.070
and those customers are flighted

00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:36.025
for the Team's only upgrade coexistence mode.

00:07:36.026 --> 00:07:38.450
So, they're the only customers right now who can

00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:40.250
fully switch the Teams

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.960
and have Skype for Business disabled.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.070
The rest of the customers are given

00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:48.950
the option of I believe,

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:52.230
Skype for Business only or Teams club,

00:07:52.231 --> 00:07:55.905
and so make sure to check out the appendix.

00:07:55.906 --> 00:07:59.295
There are some screenshots in there to understand what

00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:01.940
the coexistence mode looks like

00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:04.610
and how to set it, as well as a blog.

00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:06.935
So, make sure you go check those out.

00:08:06.936 --> 00:08:08.570
We also will be releasing

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.190
training here in the next few weeks

00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:13.690
on the upgrade story and the interrupt mode story,

00:08:13.691 --> 00:08:15.615
so make sure to look out for that.

00:08:15.616 --> 00:08:19.130
So, that does it

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:20.565
for Skype for Business Online

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:23.120
specifically or Microsoft Teams.

00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:25.040
So, now we'll move on to Phone Devices,

00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:27.110
where we've got some updates

00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:29.785
or information on Skype Room Systems.

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:32.720
So, this one is a performance issue on

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:35.814
Skype Room Systems v2 devices

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:40.830
that are on Surface Pro 2017 based devices.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:47.250
So there is a performance issues when you join

00:08:47.251 --> 00:08:48.820
a meeting with a combination

00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:52.020
of HDMI, wired ingest sharing.

00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:54.370
So, you're plugging the HDMI into your laptop,

00:08:54.371 --> 00:08:56.685
and sharing through the Skype Room System.

00:08:56.686 --> 00:08:59.820
When you have dual front-of-room displays,

00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:02.010
and multiple remote video streams being used.

00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:03.650
So, when all of those things are

00:09:03.651 --> 00:09:06.065
happening in conjunction in one meeting,

00:09:06.066 --> 00:09:08.875
you might get some performance issues.

00:09:08.876 --> 00:09:13.010
So, possible workarounds are desktop sharing into

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.390
the meeting via Skype for Business Application

00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:17.200
instead of the HDMI cable,

00:09:17.201 --> 00:09:21.040
or reducing the front-off-room display configuration

00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:23.175
to a single screen.

00:09:23.176 --> 00:09:26.390
So, that's just be aware of that if you're

00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:28.120
using all of these features

00:09:28.121 --> 00:09:30.250
of Skype Room Systems at one time,

00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:32.170
you might get some performance issues,

00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:35.935
specifically on the Surface Pro 2017 based devices.

00:09:35.936 --> 00:09:38.630
So, this is just to let you know that documentation

00:09:38.631 --> 00:09:41.610
has been updated for Skype Room Systems v2.

00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:44.550
It improves the onscreen keyboard behavior,

00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.400
or just lets you know about

00:09:46.401 --> 00:09:48.130
the onscreen keyboard behavior

00:09:48.131 --> 00:09:50.855
in version 1709 of Windows 10,

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:54.150
and improvements to prepare

00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:57.175
for updates to future operating systems.

00:09:57.176 --> 00:09:58.940
All right. Moving on to Lync,

00:09:58.941 --> 00:10:00.660
and Skype for Business desktop,

00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:04.040
and mobile clients, we also have Teams in here as well.

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:08.375
So, we will start off with Skype for Business 2015.

00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:11.815
This was an update released back on May 1st.

00:10:11.816 --> 00:10:15.970
Just one issue fixed here with a location display issue

00:10:15.971 --> 00:10:20.430
if using E911 is set to true in Skype for Business.

00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:23.060
So there, the downloads available there,

00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:26.180
as well as the KB if you'd like more information.

00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:29.204
Joe correctly called out

00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:33.310
that this should be May 1st, 2018 not 2013.

00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:35.375
So, thank you.

00:10:35.376 --> 00:10:37.695
Skype for Business 2016,

00:10:37.696 --> 00:10:39.420
also released on May 1st.

00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:41.780
I know that the same fix for

00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:46.130
the 2015 client is also in the 2016 quite right here,

00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:48.265
in addition to two other ones.

00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:51.190
So, unread messages of a reopened chatroom are

00:10:51.191 --> 00:10:52.900
incorrectly indicated when restarting

00:10:52.901 --> 00:10:54.320
Skype for Business 2016,

00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:55.910
so that issue is fixed.

00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:57.870
Another issue fixed where you

00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:00.365
were repeatedly added as a delegate.

00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:03.270
You would receive that message every time you log in

00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:05.675
to Skype for Business 2015 even if you were,

00:11:05.676 --> 00:11:08.200
had already been a member of that,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.105
or even selected as a delegate for that user.

00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:15.070
So, make sure to check out the download links,

00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:16.645
as well as KB.

00:11:16.646 --> 00:11:19.440
So, Microsoft Teams.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.580
Some of this is available

00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:26.190
publicly in your regular Team's client.

00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:28.780
You can go to the, I believe, the T bot,

00:11:28.781 --> 00:11:32.005
and look at what's new in Teams.

00:11:32.006 --> 00:11:36.320
So, just some new features,

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.255
and new improvements that they've made.

00:11:38.256 --> 00:11:39.950
I believe this was last months

00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:41.080
that we may have already covered it.

00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:43.800
So, you can now send messages from the command box.

00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:45.100
For the contact card,

00:11:45.101 --> 00:11:48.330
you can dial out or into a group call,

00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:52.180
auto import, or auto favorite import channels.

00:11:52.181 --> 00:11:54.545
That means that an admin of a channel,

00:11:54.546 --> 00:11:55.970
or an owner of a channel,

00:11:55.971 --> 00:11:58.550
or a group can automatically

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.050
favorites certain channels for

00:12:00.051 --> 00:12:01.960
you when you join the team.

00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:04.530
New views in the Microsoft Planner tab.

00:12:04.531 --> 00:12:06.090
I believe there's graph views,

00:12:06.091 --> 00:12:08.290
and different schedule views,

00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.415
you can look at the schedule all up.

00:12:10.416 --> 00:12:13.220
Then, in the charts view of the Planner tab,

00:12:13.221 --> 00:12:14.390
you can stay up to date on

00:12:14.391 --> 00:12:16.355
the status of your plans obviously.

00:12:16.356 --> 00:12:19.820
So, there's also filtering options where you can

00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:23.335
group tasks by buckets such as a sign to,

00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:24.990
progress, due dates, and labels.

00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:28.695
So, you have a lot more way to look at your project data.

00:12:28.696 --> 00:12:31.530
You can now use the SharePoint tab

00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:33.090
to place important pages,

00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:36.495
news articles, and list as individual tabs in a channel.

00:12:36.496 --> 00:12:39.160
So, instead of just having a link to one SharePoint page,

00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:43.310
you can add a list to specific SharePoint pages,

00:12:43.311 --> 00:12:46.875
and have that show up in your team channel.

00:12:46.876 --> 00:12:50.590
&gt;&gt; Hey, Darren we got a quick question regarding the

00:12:50.591 --> 00:12:53.450
delegate data fix for 2016 MSI.

00:12:53.451 --> 00:12:57.555
Does that now imply that it supports 25 delegators.

00:12:57.556 --> 00:13:02.255
&gt;&gt; I didn't get that implication from what I read.

00:13:02.256 --> 00:13:04.780
I think we'd have to check the KB for more information,

00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:11.690
but I wouldn't know off the top of my head.

00:13:11.691 --> 00:13:15.300
So, that's a good question that if it's not in the KB,

00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:17.175
we can go ahead, and take a look at that.

00:13:17.176 --> 00:13:20.300
So, Tim, if you might take a note to follow up on that.

00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:21.685
We can check later.

00:13:21.686 --> 00:13:23.020
&gt;&gt; I will do that.

00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:26.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you. All right.

00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:29.575
So, moving on more on Microsoft Teams,

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:33.240
few highlights on the iOS, and Android apps.

00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:36.635
We now have better meeting capabilities on the apps.

00:13:36.636 --> 00:13:39.050
You can request a call to your Teams

00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:41.645
phone to connect you to a meeting instead of dialing in.

00:13:41.646 --> 00:13:43.440
That's very similar to Skype for Business,

00:13:43.441 --> 00:13:44.760
and how it's done today.

00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:46.950
So, you can easily turn a one on

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.860
one call into a group call,

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:50.250
or transfer one on one call

00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:52.175
to someone else, or forward calls.

00:13:52.176 --> 00:13:54.060
This is all in the mobile app, remember.

00:13:54.061 --> 00:13:55.310
So, some of the stuff is already

00:13:55.311 --> 00:13:56.585
available on the desktop app,

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.675
now it's in mobile.

00:13:59.676 --> 00:14:03.900
So, you can now create Teams for mobile, and Teams EDU.

00:14:03.901 --> 00:14:07.970
So, specifically you have to be a EDU customer,

00:14:07.971 --> 00:14:10.480
using classrooms, and teachers,

00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:11.550
and students can now create,

00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:13.565
edit, and delete teams on mobile.

00:14:13.566 --> 00:14:17.535
So, as we announced this last week, or last month,

00:14:17.536 --> 00:14:20.005
but more about the Windows Phone apps for Teams,

00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:21.910
the app for Teams,

00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:24.040
and Skype for Business is being retired.

00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:25.890
So, after this takes effects,

00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:27.415
users would no longer be able to

00:14:27.416 --> 00:14:29.370
download the app from the Store,

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:31.595
and the app will no longer be supported.

00:14:31.596 --> 00:14:33.960
So, we'll continue to invest in the iOS,

00:14:33.961 --> 00:14:35.650
and Android apps on desktop,

00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:39.325
and Windows, but no longer the Windows Phone apps.

00:14:39.326 --> 00:14:41.570
This is essentially the same thing

00:14:41.571 --> 00:14:42.775
what I just highlighted.

00:14:42.776 --> 00:14:45.500
This takes effect July 20th.

00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:48.000
So, beginning July 20th,

00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:49.750
the app will no longer be in the Store.

00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:51.880
However, existing users will still be

00:14:51.881 --> 00:14:54.620
able to use the app until October 20th.

00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:57.840
At which point, the Teams app will no longer work,

00:14:57.841 --> 00:14:59.160
and users will see an

00:14:59.161 --> 00:15:01.110
error message when they try to connect.

00:15:01.111 --> 00:15:04.990
So, it's just recommended that if you want

00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:10.145
to continue using it until October 20th,

00:15:10.146 --> 00:15:12.450
go ahead, and install it before

00:15:12.451 --> 00:15:15.970
July 20th when it disappears from the App Store.

00:15:15.971 --> 00:15:19.145
So, additional information, there's a blog there.

00:15:19.146 --> 00:15:22.270
Moving on to Skype for Business for Mac,

00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:25.575
we have a few fixes that went into this release,

00:15:25.576 --> 00:15:27.710
that was came out May 8th.

00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:31.170
So, an issue where excessive CPU usage was

00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:33.180
happening when opening a new conversation

00:15:33.181 --> 00:15:35.250
while offline has been fixed.

00:15:35.251 --> 00:15:36.810
Another issue that prevented

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:38.850
notifications of new phone calls from

00:15:38.851 --> 00:15:40.360
being visible when

00:15:40.361 --> 00:15:42.555
a Skype for Business window was zoomed,

00:15:42.556 --> 00:15:44.800
has been fixed, changed

00:15:44.801 --> 00:15:47.550
how the IM disclaimer messages are displayed.

00:15:47.551 --> 00:15:49.110
Fixed a crash in

00:15:49.111 --> 00:15:51.995
some cases where users tries to sign out,

00:15:51.996 --> 00:15:55.140
and an issue that prevented a call window from displaying

00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:58.935
properly when trying to leave a voicemail for a contact.

00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:01.790
So, there is some additional information

00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:03.100
in the blog post here.

00:16:03.101 --> 00:16:05.755
So, Skype for Business on Windows Phone,

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.535
this is essentially what we just talked about.

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:10.690
Skype for Business on Windows Phone

00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:12.570
8.1 will no longer be available for

00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:16.370
download beginning in December 2019.

00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:18.205
Skype for Business on Windows 10 Mobile

00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:20.295
will no longer be available for download.

00:16:20.296 --> 00:16:22.660
So, that's still awaits in the future.

00:16:22.661 --> 00:16:24.560
Yeah. Same thing with Teams

00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:26.170
here just install the app before it

00:16:26.171 --> 00:16:30.650
disappears off the Store.

00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:33.800
That happens in August 2018.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.250
So, August 2018 for Windows Phone 8.1,

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.590
it won't be available for download.

00:16:42.591 --> 00:16:45.190
Then, all the way in December 2019

00:16:45.191 --> 00:16:49.030
for Skype for Business on Windows 10 Mobile.

00:16:49.031 --> 00:16:52.695
So, if your customers are still using Windows 10,

00:16:52.696 --> 00:16:54.230
make sure they know about those dates so

00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:58.175
they don't lose their-

00:16:58.176 --> 00:17:01.160
Yeah, it is kind of

00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:04.500
sad when his phone was a great little phone.

00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:06.470
So, the Network Assessment Tool,

00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:09.370
many of you may have used this or maybe aware of it.

00:17:09.371 --> 00:17:11.510
You may even have heard the announcement,

00:17:11.511 --> 00:17:13.210
but it's been updated

00:17:13.211 --> 00:17:18.170
to also do Network Assessment for Microsoft Teams now.

00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:20.170
So, even if a customer doesn't have

00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:22.120
an Office 365 subscription yet,

00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:27.120
you can still use this as a pre-sales stage to evaluate

00:17:27.121 --> 00:17:29.480
whether their network is ready to support

00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:30.900
all the various different features and

00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:32.715
functionalities of Skype for Business,

00:17:32.716 --> 00:17:34.210
whether they have enough bandwidth,

00:17:34.211 --> 00:17:37.180
whether they can connect to the specific endpoints.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.620
It does all this stuff.

00:17:38.621 --> 00:17:40.270
So, you can get it very easily

00:17:40.271 --> 00:17:45.920
by installing a PowerShell module and running

00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:49.840
the Install-Module M365NetworkTestingTool commandement,

00:17:49.841 --> 00:17:53.980
and then running Invoke-M365CreateShortcuts

00:17:53.981 --> 00:17:55.260
and that will just create a shortcut on

00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:57.145
your desktop and your Start Menu.

00:17:57.146 --> 00:17:59.850
Then go ahead and launch it.

00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:02.740
So, it is a very useful tool.

00:18:02.741 --> 00:18:05.395
It goes over a lot of information.

00:18:05.396 --> 00:18:08.800
And so, it's packaged up in a nice little UI,

00:18:08.801 --> 00:18:12.035
so your customers will be happy when they see it.

00:18:12.036 --> 00:18:15.500
So, yeah, that's been updated.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.820
The request from the tool creators

00:18:18.821 --> 00:18:20.630
is just to start using it.

00:18:20.631 --> 00:18:21.820
Get it in front of customers,

00:18:21.821 --> 00:18:22.870
figure out what they like,

00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:25.950
what they don't like, provide feedback to the tool.

00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:27.580
I believe there's definitely

00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:29.670
team channels that a lot of you

00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:32.095
are probably involved in where they've talked about this.

00:18:32.096 --> 00:18:33.950
I believe there's feedback

00:18:33.951 --> 00:18:35.640
within the tool that you can email.

00:18:35.641 --> 00:18:38.585
So, what are their plans for the tool next?

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:40.410
They want to provide

00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:43.495
each information icon that pops up when it does a test.

00:18:43.496 --> 00:18:44.610
They want to link to

00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:47.380
specific guidance on the fast track website.

00:18:47.381 --> 00:18:50.195
Right now, the order of testing is swapped.

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:53.350
They test connectivity first and then audio quality.

00:18:53.351 --> 00:18:56.395
The device parser is also updated to reflect

00:18:56.396 --> 00:18:58.250
newer headsets and speakerphones which

00:18:58.251 --> 00:19:01.015
have been certified by the call quality team.

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:03.290
The Desktop/Start Menu icons

00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:05.010
are applied when the module is updated,

00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:07.700
instead of each time the application launches.

00:19:07.701 --> 00:19:11.585
Then the public web URL's and a blog will follow soon.

00:19:11.586 --> 00:19:14.510
So, keep a look out for that.

00:19:14.511 --> 00:19:17.105
There is some additional information right here.

00:19:17.106 --> 00:19:21.800
And that does it for our releases,

00:19:21.801 --> 00:19:23.120
and updates, and stuff like that.

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:24.930
So, I'll go ahead and head back to back to

00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:27.170
Tim and he can take it from there.

00:19:27.171 --> 00:19:29.570
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much, Darren. Great overview.

00:19:29.571 --> 00:19:32.290
In terms of Special Topics and Training Releases,

00:19:32.291 --> 00:19:36.330
we'll look at the short view backwards and forwards.

00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:39.150
While I go ahead and share these slides,

00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:42.775
I want to invite people to put the chat window

00:19:42.776 --> 00:19:45.490
any request they have were

00:19:45.491 --> 00:19:48.460
training on Skype for Business or Teams topics.

00:19:48.461 --> 00:19:50.950
We have been very much focused on

00:19:50.951 --> 00:19:54.705
capturing training on major feature releases in Teams,

00:19:54.706 --> 00:19:57.050
but we also do strive to

00:19:57.051 --> 00:19:59.780
provide training on the knowledge gap areas,

00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:03.640
areas in which you're uncomfortable providing support.

00:20:03.641 --> 00:20:06.460
So, as I talk about these slides,

00:20:06.461 --> 00:20:07.990
I invite you to go ahead and toss

00:20:07.991 --> 00:20:10.075
any suggestions you have in the chat window

00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:11.850
about training topics you'd like to see

00:20:11.851 --> 00:20:14.015
coverage to up skill,

00:20:14.016 --> 00:20:16.540
where you feel like you need it.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.025
So, Recently Release Training.

00:20:20.026 --> 00:20:23.025
We're having a little bit of a problem, it looks like,

00:20:23.026 --> 00:20:27.710
with the slide show in the proper content.

00:20:27.711 --> 00:20:29.990
I'm going to go ahead and speak to this.

00:20:29.991 --> 00:20:32.385
But I won't have a visual

00:20:32.386 --> 00:20:35.170
to show you. Apologies for that.

00:20:35.171 --> 00:20:40.180
We have released Microsoft Teams Direct Routing training,

00:20:40.181 --> 00:20:42.045
as Darren alluded to,

00:20:42.046 --> 00:20:45.355
but please give us feedback on that course.

00:20:45.356 --> 00:20:46.990
This is going to give you

00:20:46.991 --> 00:20:49.110
a good overview of

00:20:49.111 --> 00:20:51.155
the direct routing value add capabilities.

00:20:51.156 --> 00:20:52.770
It's going to help you

00:20:52.771 --> 00:20:54.920
understand how direct routing is set up,

00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:56.970
and with the new features are and

00:20:56.971 --> 00:20:58.810
applying basic troubleshooting steps

00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:00.570
for various scenarios,

00:21:00.571 --> 00:21:02.200
and that includes known issues as well.

00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:05.645
So, please do check out the Direct Routing training.

00:21:05.646 --> 00:21:09.030
Prior to that, we issued our Cloud Recording Training,

00:21:09.031 --> 00:21:11.490
an another recently released feature.

00:21:11.491 --> 00:21:15.790
We also have Microsoft Teams

00:21:15.791 --> 00:21:18.645
and Skype for Business interoperability course out there

00:21:18.646 --> 00:21:21.100
that is being updated

00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:25.645
as configuration options are changing.

00:21:25.646 --> 00:21:28.375
So, please do also view that training.

00:21:28.376 --> 00:21:29.895
Again, apologies for the lack

00:21:29.896 --> 00:21:33.400
of content showing on screen.

00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:36.480
So, coming up in June for Teams,

00:21:36.481 --> 00:21:40.600
we are going to be addressing

00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:42.095
the Skype for Business to Teams

00:21:42.096 --> 00:21:45.925
Upgrade Process and Customer Experience.

00:21:45.926 --> 00:21:51.580
The schedule for these upgrades is being finalized,

00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:53.850
but we can look for this activity to kick

00:21:53.851 --> 00:21:56.170
off and start small

00:21:56.171 --> 00:21:59.080
but ramp up beginning in the next month or so.

00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:01.310
We'll also be covering Call Delegation

00:22:01.311 --> 00:22:02.975
and Consultative Transfer,

00:22:02.976 --> 00:22:04.925
and we are watching

00:22:04.926 --> 00:22:08.640
Teams Federation features lighting up,

00:22:08.641 --> 00:22:12.530
and we will be training on those features

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:14.355
as we have more information

00:22:14.356 --> 00:22:17.630
that would be useful to support agents.

00:22:17.631 --> 00:22:20.240
So, beyond that, we'll be looking

00:22:20.241 --> 00:22:23.210
to cover Teams Broadcast Meetings,

00:22:23.211 --> 00:22:25.570
which will include a new feature called

00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:28.575
Leadership Connection geared toward connecting

00:22:28.576 --> 00:22:35.495
executive leadership and companies to their audience.

00:22:35.496 --> 00:22:39.430
We are looking at consolidating PSTN Teams,

00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:42.370
PSTN Calling Feature Releases

00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:45.900
into a consolidated training as well.

00:22:45.901 --> 00:22:50.255
Our June Brown Bag is going to be on the 26.

00:22:50.256 --> 00:22:52.410
If you have an idea for a topic

00:22:52.411 --> 00:22:54.870
or anything you want to hear about,

00:22:54.871 --> 00:22:57.185
please do let us know with that email address.

00:22:57.186 --> 00:22:59.430
We'll be happy to arrange.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.600
Let me just point out

00:23:02.601 --> 00:23:05.455
a couple items on the Blogs of Note.

00:23:05.456 --> 00:23:08.990
We have that updated roadmap for

00:23:08.991 --> 00:23:12.040
the Microsoft Teams Upgrade from Skype for

00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:13.400
Business that will give a lot of

00:23:13.401 --> 00:23:15.905
information on feature plans.

00:23:15.906 --> 00:23:17.670
That's a good place to go for

00:23:17.671 --> 00:23:19.090
comprehensive information on what

00:23:19.091 --> 00:23:20.645
that activity looks like.

00:23:20.646 --> 00:23:22.475
Like I said, we'll be addressing

00:23:22.476 --> 00:23:25.695
that process in a training coming up.

00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:27.290
You'll notice that we have

00:23:27.291 --> 00:23:30.000
our planning direct routing link

00:23:30.001 --> 00:23:32.005
included in this set of blogs,

00:23:32.006 --> 00:23:35.700
which is an overview of how customers are

00:23:35.701 --> 00:23:37.530
to approach and configure and set up

00:23:37.531 --> 00:23:40.075
direct routing might be useful for you.

00:23:40.076 --> 00:23:43.860
I will just also point out that GDPR has

00:23:43.861 --> 00:23:47.355
been a big focus obviously in the last week or so.

00:23:47.356 --> 00:23:50.990
There's a link here to the specific information about how

00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:52.570
GDPR pertains to

00:23:52.571 --> 00:23:54.955
Skype for Business Server and Lync Server.

00:23:54.956 --> 00:23:56.980
And as always, we are

00:23:56.981 --> 00:23:59.320
available through our Infopedia page where

00:23:59.321 --> 00:24:01.005
you'll find our training catalog

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:03.960
and contact information for our team.

00:24:03.961 --> 00:24:06.790
I'm taking a look at the feedback we're getting in

00:24:06.791 --> 00:24:09.205
the chat window regarding

00:24:09.206 --> 00:24:10.930
topics you'd like to see covered.

00:24:10.931 --> 00:24:14.310
This is very useful information for us.

00:24:14.311 --> 00:24:16.420
We're going to take these suggestions and see

00:24:16.421 --> 00:24:18.645
if we can follow up with

00:24:18.646 --> 00:24:20.550
a guest speaker or

00:24:20.551 --> 00:24:24.200
provide you deeper information on next Brown Bag.

00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:26.730
Thank you so much. And with that,

00:24:26.731 --> 00:24:28.900
I want to thank Darren Hansen and the rest

00:24:28.901 --> 00:24:31.260
of our CSS Learning and Readiness Team.

00:24:31.261 --> 00:24:34.655
And of course, those of you who participated today.

00:24:34.656 --> 00:24:38.130
Thank you so much and have a great day.
