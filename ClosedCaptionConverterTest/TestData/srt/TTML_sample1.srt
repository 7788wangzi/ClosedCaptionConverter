1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.030
&gt;&gt; Everybody, as the top of the hour,

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:05.250
we're going to give people another couple of

3
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:08.130
minutes to join from other mediums

4
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:12.400
so we'll get started in two minutes.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.340
All right, folks. We're going to give it about one

6
00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:17.110
more minute before we get started.

7
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:21.540
All right, everybody.

8
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:22.890
It's a couple of minutes after the hour,

9
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.800
we're going to go ahead and get started as people join.

10
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.850
Welcome to the May 2018 Skype

11
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:32.745
for Business and Microsoft Teams Readiness Brown Bag.

12
00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:34.200
My name is Tim Ballew,

13
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.240
and I am the Business Program Manager

14
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:38.770
for CSS Learning for these products,

15
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.580
and I'm joined today by members of our Readiness Team:

16
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:43.305
our learning development managers

17
00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:45.390
and instructional designers.

18
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:47.440
During today's session, we'll be

19
00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:49.590
reviewing the May feature releases and updates for

20
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.945
Skype for Business and Teams' product family

21
00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:53.100
and we'll be providing

22
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:54.930
you some additional resources

23
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.450
for more information on those items.

24
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:59.880
We anticipate that today's session

25
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.600
will be roughly 50 minutes,

26
00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:04.570
we won't necessarily take the whole hour this time.

27
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:06.220
And please note that

28
00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:08.275
a recording will be made available as

29
00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:12.200
a training and success factors after the session is over.

30
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:15.600
So, a real quick reminder

31
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:20.060
about our confidentiality obligations.

32
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:22.855
We do not disclose confidential information,

33
00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:25.220
and this information that we're sharing today has not

34
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:27.525
necessarily been reviewed for public consumption.

35
00:01:27.526 --> 00:01:29.740
So, be aware.

36
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.380
Today we're going to be looking at

37
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:35.950
typical topics of Lync and Skype for Business Server.

38
00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:38.150
We'll be talking about Skype

39
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:39.970
for Business Online Calling Plans,

40
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:43.805
Direct Routing and Coexistence Modes.

41
00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:46.040
Our Phones and Devices section will

42
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:48.985
cover Skype Room Systems updates,

43
00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:52.360
and they will cover all of the clients.

44
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.840
We'll talk a little bit about the network assessment tool

45
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:59.900
and then review current recently released trainings,

46
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:02.525
they have the upcoming trainings to look out for.

47
00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:05.700
So, with that I'm going to go

48
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:08.510
ahead and hand it over to Darren Hansen,

49
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:09.690
who is going to walk us through

50
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:12.890
our features and fixes. Darren!

51
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.280
&gt;&gt; All right thank you much Tim.

52
00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:17.900
All right, so we're going to start off

53
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:19.040
today with an update

54
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:22.070
for Skype for Business Server 2015.

55
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:27.165
This is highly anticipated CU for CU7.

56
00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:31.160
It is going to come out here in June in a little bit.

57
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:33.380
We don't have an exact date but it should be

58
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:35.300
coming up in the next few weeks.

59
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:38.450
So, there are a lot of

60
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.700
fixes and improvements and

61
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:42.695
stuff like that that have gone into this update.

62
00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:45.610
We're going to highlight a few here on the slides,

63
00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:48.630
and then the majority of them are in the appendix,

64
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:50.935
which is linked right down here.

65
00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.940
So, the first one that we're going to talk

66
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.010
about is an issue where we now

67
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:57.590
support anonymous PSTN callers starting

68
00:02:57.591 --> 00:02:59.510
a static meeting without

69
00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:02.525
an authenticated user in Skype for Business.

70
00:03:02.526 --> 00:03:04.760
Another one where we support

71
00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:06.830
the end meeting functionality for

72
00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:09.995
Skype for Business on Mac in 2015,

73
00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:13.160
enabling Skype meetings app to replace

74
00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:14.810
the Skype for Business Web app and

75
00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:17.540
Skype for Business Server 2015.

76
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.265
Then Microsoft SQL servers

77
00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:25.285
2016 is available for the back end server.

78
00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:28.010
Oh! I'm sorry, Thank you Colin.

79
00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:31.130
I did not take over as presenter there.

80
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.710
All right so now you should be seeing

81
00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:35.810
the Skype for Business Server 2015

82
00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:40.350
slides with a few improvements here on the screen.

83
00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:42.820
So, we get to the last one there were

84
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:45.220
Microsoft SQL server 2016 is available

85
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:49.200
for backend servers of Skype for Business Server 2015.

86
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:51.270
So, we now support that.

87
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.485
And again, there are probably

88
00:03:54.486 --> 00:03:58.190
20 or more additional fixes and improvements

89
00:03:58.191 --> 00:04:01.130
in the appendix there so make sure you download the deck

90
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:04.570
from the meeting attachments and take a look there.

91
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.520
So, now moving off of

92
00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:10.310
server and onto sort of Skype for Business online,

93
00:04:10.311 --> 00:04:12.225
you can see that all of these things have to do

94
00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:16.180
with Microsoft Teams but they also do

95
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:19.700
reflect functionality and Skype for Business

96
00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:21.350
online too for customers who are

97
00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:23.860
using for example calling plans,

98
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:28.090
Direct Routing and coexistence modes apply.

99
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.945
But, as we move forward

100
00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:32.030
you'll also see in the top right hand corner

101
00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:36.380
that there are some logos for Teams and Skype.

102
00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:39.295
Those just help you know which

103
00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:40.580
one we're talking about on each

104
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:42.080
individual slide as we go through the deck,

105
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.750
you see we've made some updates to the template.

106
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:45.920
So, we're just trying to

107
00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:47.615
make that a little bit more clear.

108
00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:50.450
So, Microsoft Teams and

109
00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:52.340
Skype for Business Online calling plans in

110
00:04:52.341 --> 00:04:54.530
Canada are now general available,

111
00:04:54.531 --> 00:04:57.910
that was updated or released on May first.

112
00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:00.980
So, all calls between US and Canada users in

113
00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:02.360
both directions are now considered

114
00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:05.225
domestic and not international so that's a big win.

115
00:05:05.226 --> 00:05:07.535
Calling plans work with both teams

116
00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:09.415
as well as Skype for Business and you can buy

117
00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:13.720
today in Office 365 together obviously,

118
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:15.350
they make calling enabled for

119
00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:19.275
your organization using your primary phone number.

120
00:05:19.276 --> 00:05:23.285
So, make sure your customers know about that.

121
00:05:23.286 --> 00:05:25.950
There is information in the blog here.

122
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.690
Direct Routing, if you

123
00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:32.315
haven't heard about Direct Routing before.

124
00:05:32.316 --> 00:05:35.645
It's essentially CCE or Cloud.

125
00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:38.705
There are definitely two different things

126
00:05:38.706 --> 00:05:40.400
but this is basically using

127
00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:45.680
your on premise infrastructure with Teams to route calls.

128
00:05:45.681 --> 00:05:48.900
So, this was released on May 15.

129
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.655
Customers can choose to sign up for preview

130
00:05:52.656 --> 00:05:54.910
and they will get support through our in market teams.

131
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:57.505
It is a preview release,

132
00:05:57.506 --> 00:05:59.255
so just be aware of that.

133
00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:01.880
What if you do get a call and you

134
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.540
need assistance with answering direct routing calls?

135
00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:06.695
You can post your question here,

136
00:06:06.696 --> 00:06:10.085
which leads to the real one note I believe,

137
00:06:10.086 --> 00:06:12.260
and SME will respond or you

138
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:14.370
can reach out to one of these SMEs listed.

139
00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:17.055
So, I know that there are some of you on the phone,

140
00:06:17.056 --> 00:06:18.925
who are on this list so,

141
00:06:18.926 --> 00:06:22.380
I hope you don't get too many calls or questions.

142
00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:24.260
There's also plenty of

143
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:27.265
information in our training that we just released,

144
00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:30.570
as well as the UC real one note documents.

145
00:06:30.571 --> 00:06:33.890
So, Carolyn and other SMEs did a

146
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.260
really bang up job in documenting Direct Routing,

147
00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:39.820
documenting troubleshooting methodologies,

148
00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:42.440
scenarios, all sorts of stuff.

149
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:45.530
So, it's very well understood product

150
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:47.740
at this point and we're just entering previews.

151
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:54.890
So, coexistence mode, you may have also heard about this.

152
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:58.310
Greg talked about it in our last brown bag last month,

153
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:00.200
when he demo the modern portal

154
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:02.450
and the modes for upgrading.

155
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:06.815
So, the modern portal now removes the interrupt policy

156
00:07:06.816 --> 00:07:08.090
and upgrade policy as

157
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:12.335
two separate entities and gives us coexistence modes.

158
00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:14.555
The goal is to consolidate

159
00:07:14.556 --> 00:07:16.070
the upgrade experience when

160
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:18.020
transitioning from Skype for Business to Teams,

161
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.550
because it's pretty confusing as it is today.

162
00:07:20.551 --> 00:07:23.370
There are some customers and TAP,

163
00:07:23.371 --> 00:07:28.390
who have already set the Teams interrupt policy before,

164
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:32.070
and those customers are flighted

165
00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:36.025
for the Team's only upgrade coexistence mode.

166
00:07:36.026 --> 00:07:38.450
So, they're the only customers right now who can

167
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:40.250
fully switch the Teams

168
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.960
and have Skype for Business disabled.

169
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.070
The rest of the customers are given

170
00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:48.950
the option of I believe,

171
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:52.230
Skype for Business only or Teams club,

172
00:07:52.231 --> 00:07:55.905
and so make sure to check out the appendix.

173
00:07:55.906 --> 00:07:59.295
There are some screenshots in there to understand what

174
00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:01.940
the coexistence mode looks like

175
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:04.610
and how to set it, as well as a blog.

176
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:06.935
So, make sure you go check those out.

177
00:08:06.936 --> 00:08:08.570
We also will be releasing

178
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.190
training here in the next few weeks

179
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:13.690
on the upgrade story and the interrupt mode story,

180
00:08:13.691 --> 00:08:15.615
so make sure to look out for that.

181
00:08:15.616 --> 00:08:19.130
So, that does it

182
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:20.565
for Skype for Business Online

183
00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:23.120
specifically or Microsoft Teams.

184
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:25.040
So, now we'll move on to Phone Devices,

185
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:27.110
where we've got some updates

186
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:29.785
or information on Skype Room Systems.

187
00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:32.720
So, this one is a performance issue on

188
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:35.814
Skype Room Systems v2 devices

189
00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:40.830
that are on Surface Pro 2017 based devices.

190
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:47.250
So there is a performance issues when you join

191
00:08:47.251 --> 00:08:48.820
a meeting with a combination

192
00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:52.020
of HDMI, wired ingest sharing.

193
00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:54.370
So, you're plugging the HDMI into your laptop,

194
00:08:54.371 --> 00:08:56.685
and sharing through the Skype Room System.

195
00:08:56.686 --> 00:08:59.820
When you have dual front-of-room displays,

196
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:02.010
and multiple remote video streams being used.

197
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:03.650
So, when all of those things are

198
00:09:03.651 --> 00:09:06.065
happening in conjunction in one meeting,

199
00:09:06.066 --> 00:09:08.875
you might get some performance issues.

200
00:09:08.876 --> 00:09:13.010
So, possible workarounds are desktop sharing into

201
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.390
the meeting via Skype for Business Application

202
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:17.200
instead of the HDMI cable,

203
00:09:17.201 --> 00:09:21.040
or reducing the front-off-room display configuration

204
00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:23.175
to a single screen.

205
00:09:23.176 --> 00:09:26.390
So, that's just be aware of that if you're

206
00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:28.120
using all of these features

207
00:09:28.121 --> 00:09:30.250
of Skype Room Systems at one time,

208
00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:32.170
you might get some performance issues,

209
00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:35.935
specifically on the Surface Pro 2017 based devices.

210
00:09:35.936 --> 00:09:38.630
So, this is just to let you know that documentation

211
00:09:38.631 --> 00:09:41.610
has been updated for Skype Room Systems v2.

212
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:44.550
It improves the onscreen keyboard behavior,

213
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.400
or just lets you know about

214
00:09:46.401 --> 00:09:48.130
the onscreen keyboard behavior

215
00:09:48.131 --> 00:09:50.855
in version 1709 of Windows 10,

216
00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:54.150
and improvements to prepare

217
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:57.175
for updates to future operating systems.

218
00:09:57.176 --> 00:09:58.940
All right. Moving on to Lync,

219
00:09:58.941 --> 00:10:00.660
and Skype for Business desktop,

220
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:04.040
and mobile clients, we also have Teams in here as well.

221
00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:08.375
So, we will start off with Skype for Business 2015.

222
00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:11.815
This was an update released back on May 1st.

223
00:10:11.816 --> 00:10:15.970
Just one issue fixed here with a location display issue

224
00:10:15.971 --> 00:10:20.430
if using E911 is set to true in Skype for Business.

225
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:23.060
So there, the downloads available there,

226
00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:26.180
as well as the KB if you'd like more information.

227
00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:29.204
Joe correctly called out

228
00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:33.310
that this should be May 1st, 2018 not 2013.

229
00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:35.375
So, thank you.

230
00:10:35.376 --> 00:10:37.695
Skype for Business 2016,

231
00:10:37.696 --> 00:10:39.420
also released on May 1st.

232
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:41.780
I know that the same fix for

233
00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:46.130
the 2015 client is also in the 2016 quite right here,

234
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:48.265
in addition to two other ones.

235
00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:51.190
So, unread messages of a reopened chatroom are

236
00:10:51.191 --> 00:10:52.900
incorrectly indicated when restarting

237
00:10:52.901 --> 00:10:54.320
Skype for Business 2016,

238
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:55.910
so that issue is fixed.

239
00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:57.870
Another issue fixed where you

240
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:00.365
were repeatedly added as a delegate.

241
00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:03.270
You would receive that message every time you log in

242
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:05.675
to Skype for Business 2015 even if you were,

243
00:11:05.676 --> 00:11:08.200
had already been a member of that,

244
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.105
or even selected as a delegate for that user.

245
00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:15.070
So, make sure to check out the download links,

246
00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:16.645
as well as KB.

247
00:11:16.646 --> 00:11:19.440
So, Microsoft Teams.

248
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.580
Some of this is available

249
00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:26.190
publicly in your regular Team's client.

250
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:28.780
You can go to the, I believe, the T bot,

251
00:11:28.781 --> 00:11:32.005
and look at what's new in Teams.

252
00:11:32.006 --> 00:11:36.320
So, just some new features,

253
00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.255
and new improvements that they've made.

254
00:11:38.256 --> 00:11:39.950
I believe this was last months

255
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:41.080
that we may have already covered it.

256
00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:43.800
So, you can now send messages from the command box.

257
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:45.100
For the contact card,

258
00:11:45.101 --> 00:11:48.330
you can dial out or into a group call,

259
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:52.180
auto import, or auto favorite import channels.

260
00:11:52.181 --> 00:11:54.545
That means that an admin of a channel,

261
00:11:54.546 --> 00:11:55.970
or an owner of a channel,

262
00:11:55.971 --> 00:11:58.550
or a group can automatically

263
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.050
favorites certain channels for

264
00:12:00.051 --> 00:12:01.960
you when you join the team.

265
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:04.530
New views in the Microsoft Planner tab.

266
00:12:04.531 --> 00:12:06.090
I believe there's graph views,

267
00:12:06.091 --> 00:12:08.290
and different schedule views,

268
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.415
you can look at the schedule all up.

269
00:12:10.416 --> 00:12:13.220
Then, in the charts view of the Planner tab,

270
00:12:13.221 --> 00:12:14.390
you can stay up to date on

271
00:12:14.391 --> 00:12:16.355
the status of your plans obviously.

272
00:12:16.356 --> 00:12:19.820
So, there's also filtering options where you can

273
00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:23.335
group tasks by buckets such as a sign to,

274
00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:24.990
progress, due dates, and labels.

275
00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:28.695
So, you have a lot more way to look at your project data.

276
00:12:28.696 --> 00:12:31.530
You can now use the SharePoint tab

277
00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:33.090
to place important pages,

278
00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:36.495
news articles, and list as individual tabs in a channel.

279
00:12:36.496 --> 00:12:39.160
So, instead of just having a link to one SharePoint page,

280
00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:43.310
you can add a list to specific SharePoint pages,

281
00:12:43.311 --> 00:12:46.875
and have that show up in your team channel.

282
00:12:46.876 --> 00:12:50.590
&gt;&gt; Hey, Darren we got a quick question regarding the

283
00:12:50.591 --> 00:12:53.450
delegate data fix for 2016 MSI.

284
00:12:53.451 --> 00:12:57.555
Does that now imply that it supports 25 delegators.

285
00:12:57.556 --> 00:13:02.255
&gt;&gt; I didn't get that implication from what I read.

286
00:13:02.256 --> 00:13:04.780
I think we'd have to check the KB for more information,

287
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:11.690
but I wouldn't know off the top of my head.

288
00:13:11.691 --> 00:13:15.300
So, that's a good question that if it's not in the KB,

289
00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:17.175
we can go ahead, and take a look at that.

290
00:13:17.176 --> 00:13:20.300
So, Tim, if you might take a note to follow up on that.

291
00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:21.685
We can check later.

292
00:13:21.686 --> 00:13:23.020
&gt;&gt; I will do that.

293
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:26.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you. All right.

294
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:29.575
So, moving on more on Microsoft Teams,

295
00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:33.240
few highlights on the iOS, and Android apps.

296
00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:36.635
We now have better meeting capabilities on the apps.

297
00:13:36.636 --> 00:13:39.050
You can request a call to your Teams

298
00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:41.645
phone to connect you to a meeting instead of dialing in.

299
00:13:41.646 --> 00:13:43.440
That's very similar to Skype for Business,

300
00:13:43.441 --> 00:13:44.760
and how it's done today.

301
00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:46.950
So, you can easily turn a one on

302
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.860
one call into a group call,

303
00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:50.250
or transfer one on one call

304
00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:52.175
to someone else, or forward calls.

305
00:13:52.176 --> 00:13:54.060
This is all in the mobile app, remember.

306
00:13:54.061 --> 00:13:55.310
So, some of the stuff is already

307
00:13:55.311 --> 00:13:56.585
available on the desktop app,

308
00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.675
now it's in mobile.

309
00:13:59.676 --> 00:14:03.900
So, you can now create Teams for mobile, and Teams EDU.

310
00:14:03.901 --> 00:14:07.970
So, specifically you have to be a EDU customer,

311
00:14:07.971 --> 00:14:10.480
using classrooms, and teachers,

312
00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:11.550
and students can now create,

313
00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:13.565
edit, and delete teams on mobile.

314
00:14:13.566 --> 00:14:17.535
So, as we announced this last week, or last month,

315
00:14:17.536 --> 00:14:20.005
but more about the Windows Phone apps for Teams,

316
00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:21.910
the app for Teams,

317
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:24.040
and Skype for Business is being retired.

318
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:25.890
So, after this takes effects,

319
00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:27.415
users would no longer be able to

320
00:14:27.416 --> 00:14:29.370
download the app from the Store,

321
00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:31.595
and the app will no longer be supported.

322
00:14:31.596 --> 00:14:33.960
So, we'll continue to invest in the iOS,

323
00:14:33.961 --> 00:14:35.650
and Android apps on desktop,

324
00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:39.325
and Windows, but no longer the Windows Phone apps.

325
00:14:39.326 --> 00:14:41.570
This is essentially the same thing

326
00:14:41.571 --> 00:14:42.775
what I just highlighted.

327
00:14:42.776 --> 00:14:45.500
This takes effect July 20th.

328
00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:48.000
So, beginning July 20th,

329
00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:49.750
the app will no longer be in the Store.

330
00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:51.880
However, existing users will still be

331
00:14:51.881 --> 00:14:54.620
able to use the app until October 20th.

332
00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:57.840
At which point, the Teams app will no longer work,

333
00:14:57.841 --> 00:14:59.160
and users will see an

334
00:14:59.161 --> 00:15:01.110
error message when they try to connect.

335
00:15:01.111 --> 00:15:04.990
So, it's just recommended that if you want

336
00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:10.145
to continue using it until October 20th,

337
00:15:10.146 --> 00:15:12.450
go ahead, and install it before

338
00:15:12.451 --> 00:15:15.970
July 20th when it disappears from the App Store.

339
00:15:15.971 --> 00:15:19.145
So, additional information, there's a blog there.

340
00:15:19.146 --> 00:15:22.270
Moving on to Skype for Business for Mac,

341
00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:25.575
we have a few fixes that went into this release,

342
00:15:25.576 --> 00:15:27.710
that was came out May 8th.

343
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:31.170
So, an issue where excessive CPU usage was

344
00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:33.180
happening when opening a new conversation

345
00:15:33.181 --> 00:15:35.250
while offline has been fixed.

346
00:15:35.251 --> 00:15:36.810
Another issue that prevented

347
00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:38.850
notifications of new phone calls from

348
00:15:38.851 --> 00:15:40.360
being visible when

349
00:15:40.361 --> 00:15:42.555
a Skype for Business window was zoomed,

350
00:15:42.556 --> 00:15:44.800
has been fixed, changed

351
00:15:44.801 --> 00:15:47.550
how the IM disclaimer messages are displayed.

352
00:15:47.551 --> 00:15:49.110
Fixed a crash in

353
00:15:49.111 --> 00:15:51.995
some cases where users tries to sign out,

354
00:15:51.996 --> 00:15:55.140
and an issue that prevented a call window from displaying

355
00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:58.935
properly when trying to leave a voicemail for a contact.

356
00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:01.790
So, there is some additional information

357
00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:03.100
in the blog post here.

358
00:16:03.101 --> 00:16:05.755
So, Skype for Business on Windows Phone,

359
00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.535
this is essentially what we just talked about.

360
00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:10.690
Skype for Business on Windows Phone

361
00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:12.570
8.1 will no longer be available for

362
00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:16.370
download beginning in December 2019.

363
00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:18.205
Skype for Business on Windows 10 Mobile

364
00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:20.295
will no longer be available for download.

365
00:16:20.296 --> 00:16:22.660
So, that's still awaits in the future.

366
00:16:22.661 --> 00:16:24.560
Yeah. Same thing with Teams

367
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:26.170
here just install the app before it

368
00:16:26.171 --> 00:16:30.650
disappears off the Store.

369
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:33.800
That happens in August 2018.

370
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.250
So, August 2018 for Windows Phone 8.1,

371
00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.590
it won't be available for download.

372
00:16:42.591 --> 00:16:45.190
Then, all the way in December 2019

373
00:16:45.191 --> 00:16:49.030
for Skype for Business on Windows 10 Mobile.

374
00:16:49.031 --> 00:16:52.695
So, if your customers are still using Windows 10,

375
00:16:52.696 --> 00:16:54.230
make sure they know about those dates so

376
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:58.175
they don't lose their-

377
00:16:58.176 --> 00:17:01.160
Yeah, it is kind of

378
00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:04.500
sad when his phone was a great little phone.

379
00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:06.470
So, the Network Assessment Tool,

380
00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:09.370
many of you may have used this or maybe aware of it.

381
00:17:09.371 --> 00:17:11.510
You may even have heard the announcement,

382
00:17:11.511 --> 00:17:13.210
but it's been updated

383
00:17:13.211 --> 00:17:18.170
to also do Network Assessment for Microsoft Teams now.

384
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:20.170
So, even if a customer doesn't have

385
00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:22.120
an Office 365 subscription yet,

386
00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:27.120
you can still use this as a pre-sales stage to evaluate

387
00:17:27.121 --> 00:17:29.480
whether their network is ready to support

388
00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:30.900
all the various different features and

389
00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:32.715
functionalities of Skype for Business,

390
00:17:32.716 --> 00:17:34.210
whether they have enough bandwidth,

391
00:17:34.211 --> 00:17:37.180
whether they can connect to the specific endpoints.

392
00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.620
It does all this stuff.

393
00:17:38.621 --> 00:17:40.270
So, you can get it very easily

394
00:17:40.271 --> 00:17:45.920
by installing a PowerShell module and running

395
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:49.840
the Install-Module M365NetworkTestingTool commandement,

396
00:17:49.841 --> 00:17:53.980
and then running Invoke-M365CreateShortcuts

397
00:17:53.981 --> 00:17:55.260
and that will just create a shortcut on

398
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:57.145
your desktop and your Start Menu.

399
00:17:57.146 --> 00:17:59.850
Then go ahead and launch it.

400
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:02.740
So, it is a very useful tool.

401
00:18:02.741 --> 00:18:05.395
It goes over a lot of information.

402
00:18:05.396 --> 00:18:08.800
And so, it's packaged up in a nice little UI,

403
00:18:08.801 --> 00:18:12.035
so your customers will be happy when they see it.

404
00:18:12.036 --> 00:18:15.500
So, yeah, that's been updated.

405
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.820
The request from the tool creators

406
00:18:18.821 --> 00:18:20.630
is just to start using it.

407
00:18:20.631 --> 00:18:21.820
Get it in front of customers,

408
00:18:21.821 --> 00:18:22.870
figure out what they like,

409
00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:25.950
what they don't like, provide feedback to the tool.

410
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:27.580
I believe there's definitely

411
00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:29.670
team channels that a lot of you

412
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:32.095
are probably involved in where they've talked about this.

413
00:18:32.096 --> 00:18:33.950
I believe there's feedback

414
00:18:33.951 --> 00:18:35.640
within the tool that you can email.

415
00:18:35.641 --> 00:18:38.585
So, what are their plans for the tool next?

416
00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:40.410
They want to provide

417
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:43.495
each information icon that pops up when it does a test.

418
00:18:43.496 --> 00:18:44.610
They want to link to

419
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:47.380
specific guidance on the fast track website.

420
00:18:47.381 --> 00:18:50.195
Right now, the order of testing is swapped.

421
00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:53.350
They test connectivity first and then audio quality.

422
00:18:53.351 --> 00:18:56.395
The device parser is also updated to reflect

423
00:18:56.396 --> 00:18:58.250
newer headsets and speakerphones which

424
00:18:58.251 --> 00:19:01.015
have been certified by the call quality team.

425
00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:03.290
The Desktop/Start Menu icons

426
00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:05.010
are applied when the module is updated,

427
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:07.700
instead of each time the application launches.

428
00:19:07.701 --> 00:19:11.585
Then the public web URL's and a blog will follow soon.

429
00:19:11.586 --> 00:19:14.510
So, keep a look out for that.

430
00:19:14.511 --> 00:19:17.105
There is some additional information right here.

431
00:19:17.106 --> 00:19:21.800
And that does it for our releases,

432
00:19:21.801 --> 00:19:23.120
and updates, and stuff like that.

433
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:24.930
So, I'll go ahead and head back to back to

434
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:27.170
Tim and he can take it from there.

435
00:19:27.171 --> 00:19:29.570
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much, Darren. Great overview.

436
00:19:29.571 --> 00:19:32.290
In terms of Special Topics and Training Releases,

437
00:19:32.291 --> 00:19:36.330
we'll look at the short view backwards and forwards.

438
00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:39.150
While I go ahead and share these slides,

439
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:42.775
I want to invite people to put the chat window

440
00:19:42.776 --> 00:19:45.490
any request they have were

441
00:19:45.491 --> 00:19:48.460
training on Skype for Business or Teams topics.

442
00:19:48.461 --> 00:19:50.950
We have been very much focused on

443
00:19:50.951 --> 00:19:54.705
capturing training on major feature releases in Teams,

444
00:19:54.706 --> 00:19:57.050
but we also do strive to

445
00:19:57.051 --> 00:19:59.780
provide training on the knowledge gap areas,

446
00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:03.640
areas in which you're uncomfortable providing support.

447
00:20:03.641 --> 00:20:06.460
So, as I talk about these slides,

448
00:20:06.461 --> 00:20:07.990
I invite you to go ahead and toss

449
00:20:07.991 --> 00:20:10.075
any suggestions you have in the chat window

450
00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:11.850
about training topics you'd like to see

451
00:20:11.851 --> 00:20:14.015
coverage to up skill,

452
00:20:14.016 --> 00:20:16.540
where you feel like you need it.

453
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.025
So, Recently Release Training.

454
00:20:20.026 --> 00:20:23.025
We're having a little bit of a problem, it looks like,

455
00:20:23.026 --> 00:20:27.710
with the slide show in the proper content.

456
00:20:27.711 --> 00:20:29.990
I'm going to go ahead and speak to this.

457
00:20:29.991 --> 00:20:32.385
But I won't have a visual

458
00:20:32.386 --> 00:20:35.170
to show you. Apologies for that.

459
00:20:35.171 --> 00:20:40.180
We have released Microsoft Teams Direct Routing training,

460
00:20:40.181 --> 00:20:42.045
as Darren alluded to,

461
00:20:42.046 --> 00:20:45.355
but please give us feedback on that course.

462
00:20:45.356 --> 00:20:46.990
This is going to give you

463
00:20:46.991 --> 00:20:49.110
a good overview of

464
00:20:49.111 --> 00:20:51.155
the direct routing value add capabilities.

465
00:20:51.156 --> 00:20:52.770
It's going to help you

466
00:20:52.771 --> 00:20:54.920
understand how direct routing is set up,

467
00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:56.970
and with the new features are and

468
00:20:56.971 --> 00:20:58.810
applying basic troubleshooting steps

469
00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:00.570
for various scenarios,

470
00:21:00.571 --> 00:21:02.200
and that includes known issues as well.

471
00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:05.645
So, please do check out the Direct Routing training.

472
00:21:05.646 --> 00:21:09.030
Prior to that, we issued our Cloud Recording Training,

473
00:21:09.031 --> 00:21:11.490
an another recently released feature.

474
00:21:11.491 --> 00:21:15.790
We also have Microsoft Teams

475
00:21:15.791 --> 00:21:18.645
and Skype for Business interoperability course out there

476
00:21:18.646 --> 00:21:21.100
that is being updated

477
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:25.645
as configuration options are changing.

478
00:21:25.646 --> 00:21:28.375
So, please do also view that training.

479
00:21:28.376 --> 00:21:29.895
Again, apologies for the lack

480
00:21:29.896 --> 00:21:33.400
of content showing on screen.

481
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:36.480
So, coming up in June for Teams,

482
00:21:36.481 --> 00:21:40.600
we are going to be addressing

483
00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:42.095
the Skype for Business to Teams

484
00:21:42.096 --> 00:21:45.925
Upgrade Process and Customer Experience.

485
00:21:45.926 --> 00:21:51.580
The schedule for these upgrades is being finalized,

486
00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:53.850
but we can look for this activity to kick

487
00:21:53.851 --> 00:21:56.170
off and start small

488
00:21:56.171 --> 00:21:59.080
but ramp up beginning in the next month or so.

489
00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:01.310
We'll also be covering Call Delegation

490
00:22:01.311 --> 00:22:02.975
and Consultative Transfer,

491
00:22:02.976 --> 00:22:04.925
and we are watching

492
00:22:04.926 --> 00:22:08.640
Teams Federation features lighting up,

493
00:22:08.641 --> 00:22:12.530
and we will be training on those features

494
00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:14.355
as we have more information

495
00:22:14.356 --> 00:22:17.630
that would be useful to support agents.

496
00:22:17.631 --> 00:22:20.240
So, beyond that, we'll be looking

497
00:22:20.241 --> 00:22:23.210
to cover Teams Broadcast Meetings,

498
00:22:23.211 --> 00:22:25.570
which will include a new feature called

499
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:28.575
Leadership Connection geared toward connecting

500
00:22:28.576 --> 00:22:35.495
executive leadership and companies to their audience.

501
00:22:35.496 --> 00:22:39.430
We are looking at consolidating PSTN Teams,

502
00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:42.370
PSTN Calling Feature Releases

503
00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:45.900
into a consolidated training as well.

504
00:22:45.901 --> 00:22:50.255
Our June Brown Bag is going to be on the 26.

505
00:22:50.256 --> 00:22:52.410
If you have an idea for a topic

506
00:22:52.411 --> 00:22:54.870
or anything you want to hear about,

507
00:22:54.871 --> 00:22:57.185
please do let us know with that email address.

508
00:22:57.186 --> 00:22:59.430
We'll be happy to arrange.

509
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.600
Let me just point out

510
00:23:02.601 --> 00:23:05.455
a couple items on the Blogs of Note.

511
00:23:05.456 --> 00:23:08.990
We have that updated roadmap for

512
00:23:08.991 --> 00:23:12.040
the Microsoft Teams Upgrade from Skype for

513
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:13.400
Business that will give a lot of

514
00:23:13.401 --> 00:23:15.905
information on feature plans.

515
00:23:15.906 --> 00:23:17.670
That's a good place to go for

516
00:23:17.671 --> 00:23:19.090
comprehensive information on what

517
00:23:19.091 --> 00:23:20.645
that activity looks like.

518
00:23:20.646 --> 00:23:22.475
Like I said, we'll be addressing

519
00:23:22.476 --> 00:23:25.695
that process in a training coming up.

520
00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:27.290
You'll notice that we have

521
00:23:27.291 --> 00:23:30.000
our planning direct routing link

522
00:23:30.001 --> 00:23:32.005
included in this set of blogs,

523
00:23:32.006 --> 00:23:35.700
which is an overview of how customers are

524
00:23:35.701 --> 00:23:37.530
to approach and configure and set up

525
00:23:37.531 --> 00:23:40.075
direct routing might be useful for you.

526
00:23:40.076 --> 00:23:43.860
I will just also point out that GDPR has

527
00:23:43.861 --> 00:23:47.355
been a big focus obviously in the last week or so.

528
00:23:47.356 --> 00:23:50.990
There's a link here to the specific information about how

529
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:52.570
GDPR pertains to

530
00:23:52.571 --> 00:23:54.955
Skype for Business Server and Lync Server.

531
00:23:54.956 --> 00:23:56.980
And as always, we are

532
00:23:56.981 --> 00:23:59.320
available through our Infopedia page where

533
00:23:59.321 --> 00:24:01.005
you'll find our training catalog

534
00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:03.960
and contact information for our team.

535
00:24:03.961 --> 00:24:06.790
I'm taking a look at the feedback we're getting in

536
00:24:06.791 --> 00:24:09.205
the chat window regarding

537
00:24:09.206 --> 00:24:10.930
topics you'd like to see covered.

538
00:24:10.931 --> 00:24:14.310
This is very useful information for us.

539
00:24:14.311 --> 00:24:16.420
We're going to take these suggestions and see

540
00:24:16.421 --> 00:24:18.645
if we can follow up with

541
00:24:18.646 --> 00:24:20.550
a guest speaker or

542
00:24:20.551 --> 00:24:24.200
