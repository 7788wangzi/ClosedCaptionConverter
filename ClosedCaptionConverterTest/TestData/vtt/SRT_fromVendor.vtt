00:00:01.107 --> 00:00:06.106
Before we jump into our demonstrations and we start walking through our specific scenarios,

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:08.052
let's take an opportunity just to introduce you to the

00:00:08.052 --> 00:00:11.524
company that we'll be using throughout this entire course.

00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:14.317
And so they're a financial services company named HCL,

00:00:14.317 --> 00:00:17.949
and they really focus on large to enterprise customers,

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.404
although they do some have small and medium size business

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:23.310
customers in there as well. The size of the deals,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.867
they really do loans and loan generation as well as some financing

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:30.813
options both for new construction as well as existing construction,

00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:37.430
as well as they do some lease referral information as well. And depending on the size of the deal,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.803
it really varies depending upon the specific product services that they're looking at, and sometimes that

00:00:42.803 --> 00:00:47.223
can be affected by some of the different loan origination dates and items that they're working with.

00:00:47.223 --> 00:00:51.633
They do have a lot of customers who are very heavy on social media, and we'll talk a

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:55.554
little bit more about the social media aspect of it when we get into another module,

00:00:55.554 --> 00:01:01.351
but they do have a very proven sales methodology that really isn't being followed by their employees.

00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:04.643
And so what they've noticed over the last year or so is that they've

00:01:04.643 --> 00:01:07.806
really started to lose a lot more deals than they normally do,

00:01:07.806 --> 00:01:10.520
and they've been able to really trace that back to not

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.523
following the proven sales methodology that they have.

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:16.975
So they want to come up with a better way to be able to enforce

00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:19.938
that functionality and be able to work with it from there.

00:01:19.938 --> 00:01:24.977
And they also have their leads coming in from many different scenarios. It could be customers coming

00:01:24.977 --> 00:01:30.671
in to trade shows and sales or relationship executives entering that information into the system.

00:01:30.671 --> 00:01:33.927
It could be leads coming in from websites that they're looking

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.561
at. It could just be items coming into the application.

00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:40.611
But they want to provide multiple ways for leads to come into the system. And then they

00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:45.590
also understand that many of their users spend a lot of their time in other applications,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.302
it might be Outlook, might be Word, might be Excel, and they want to be

00:01:49.302 --> 00:01:53.113
sure that they're able to leverage some of those existing technologies,

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:57.752
particularly from an Outlook perspective, to be able to effectively enter

00:01:57.752 --> 00:02:02.372
information into the application without having to do a lot of back and forth.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:06.093
And so that's really the company that we're going to look at in this particular module, and the

00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:12.479
remaining items are really going to identify how Dynamics 365 for Sales can really help provide

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:18.070
each one of those individual situations and meet those needs that they're looking for.
